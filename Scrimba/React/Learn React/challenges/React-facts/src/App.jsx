      section project. Check the Google slide for what you're trying to build.
      We'll be adding more styling to it later. Hints: * The React logo is a
      file in the project tree, so you can access it by using
      `src="react-logo.png"` in your image element * You can also set the
      `width` attribute of the image element just like in HTML. In the slide, I
      have it set to 40px  */}
